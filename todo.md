# Security

- [ ] Normalize the emails mean store in lowecase format for comparison/auth/. and one field for storing the original userName
- [ ] make password pattern more strong
- [ ] Stored hashed tokens instead of plain text tokens for new-verification/password-reset/2FA
- [ ] apply rate limiting
- [ ] use db Transactions for related things

## UX

- [ ] also send a link along with 2FA token token for 2FA.
